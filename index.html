                <p>
                    My name is Carson James. I am 24 years old. I have 2 dogs, Harper and Cooper. Cooper has just joined
                    my circle. He is my girlfriends puppy. I am a college graduate from the University of North Carolina
                    at Chapel Hill. I graduated with a degree in Exercise and Sports Science. Currently I am employed in
                    a commission sales job with Verizon Wireless. I am taking this course to advance my career and get
                    out of my current role in the job that I am in and hopefully find a passionate career in the world
                    of coding and web development.

                    Hobbies I enjoy include cooking, baseball/softball, golf, video games, and traveling. Some other fun
                    facts about me include being left-handed and having green eyes. I am also the spitting image of my grandfather when he was younger.
