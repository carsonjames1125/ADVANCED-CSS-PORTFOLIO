# Carson James Portfolio

## Description

In this challenge for the week I was tasked with the job of putting together a portfolio with a title, nav bar, separate sections with descriptions and images to detail those sections. I built this project to learn more about CSS styling and HTML formatting. The problem this solved was that i know have a webpage that has GitHub links to some of my work, my Resume, my contact info, and a little description of me all in one place. I learned more about the usage of CSS and HTML properties and how they format and design a website.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
